## Introduction

Guavascript is a strongly and statically typed language that compiles down to Javascript. With type inference, first class functions, and other features. Guavascript is packed with tools to make a programmer's job easier.  Designed with a minimalistic approach to reduce the amount of time programmers have
to spend typing a worrying about syntax.  Similarly, Guavascript incorporates list comprehension, pattern matching, and the for-in loop to produce a more innately intuitive programming language that cuts out unnecessary in between logic.

Finally a programming language that doesn’t waste your time with overly
unnecessary grammars and symbols. You’re better off spending your time
completing your program as quickly as possible. Guavascript wont crash and
kill your computer either. With our compiler Guavascript becomes Javascript.

## Features

* Boolean: `True`, `False`
* String: `“guava”`, `“Don’t throw guavas in the lavas”`, `“The guava said, \“I am delicious.\””`
* List (Heterogeneous allowed): `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `[“I”, 8, 50.4, “guavas”]`
* Tuple (Heterogeneous allowed): `(30, 0.5, “guava”)`
* Dictionary: `{key:“value”, bestColor:“Guava”, worstLanguage: “php”}`
* Comments: `(‘) Single line comment`, `:) Single line comment`, or:

## Example Programs

This example program prints out the fibonacci sequence.

Guavascript:                                  Javascript:

```
fibonacci(x) {
	a = 0, b = 1, c
	if (x < 3) {

	}
}







fib x y z
	a = 0, b = 1, c
	if x < 3
		ret 1
	while --x > 0
		c = a + b, a = b, b = c
	match a
		1 > ret 2.424
		2 > ret 5.135
		_ > ret 4.135
	ret c

function fibonacci(x) {
	var a = 0, b = 1, c;
	if (x < 3) return 1;
	while (--x > 0) {
		c = a + b, a = b, b = c;
	}
	return c;
}							
```

This example program does .
