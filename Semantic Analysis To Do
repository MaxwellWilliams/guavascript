Semantic Analysis To Do's:
    - How are we going to store the "id", the key value in the
        lookup table, of something like "f[2]" or "object.thing.method(42)[0].call(true)"
    - How are we going to check for match case exhaustiveness?
    - Add a "used" field to each local variable in order to check for unusedLocalVariable error
    - For function declarations, need to infer type of parameters and add it to a field in it's
        symbolTable entry. With the type signature, we can check for parameterArgumentMismatch
    - For class declarations, need to store a constructor parameter signature field so that we
        can check for parameterArgumentMismatch for classes.
    - Analyze the recursive part of idExpression
    - When you declare a class, you need to also declare a function with the same name
        (the constructor) so that you can legally instantiate an instance of the class.
        How do you get the parameter signature from the constructor inside the class?
