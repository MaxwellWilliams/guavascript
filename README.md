## Introduction

Guavascript is a strongly and statically typed language that compiles down to Javascript. With type inference, first class functions, and other features. Guavascript is packed with tools to make a programmer's job easier.  Designed with a minimalistic approach to reduce the amount of time programmers have
to spend typing a worrying about syntax.  Similarly, Guavascript incorporates list comprehension, pattern matching, and the for-in loop to produce a more innately intuitive programming language that cuts out unnecessary in between logic.

## Features
* .guav File Extension
* Curly Braces
* Pattern Matching
* Object-oriented
* First Class Functions
* Higher Order Functions
* Type Inference
* Static Typing
* Strong Typing
* Optional Parameters
* Parenthesis required for if / while / functions

### Operators

* Additive: `+`, `-`
* Multiplicative: `*`, `/`
* Relational: `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`
* Boolean: `&&`, `||`

### Data Types

* Int: `4`, `8`, `666`
* Float: `4.0`, `3.1415926`, `0.7734`
* Boolean: `True`, `False`
* String: `“guava”`, `“Don’t throw guavas in the lavas”`, `“The guava said, \“I am delicious.\””`
* List (Heterogeneous allowed): `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `[“I”, 8, 50.4, “guavas”]`
* Tuple (Heterogeneous allowed): `(30, 0.5, “guava”)`
* Dictionary: `{key:“value”, bestColor:“Guava”, worstLanguage: “php”}`
* Comments: `(‘) Single line comment`, `:) Single line comment`, or:
 ```

print('hello, world!')                      console.log(‘hello, world!’)
```

Variable Declarations
```
name = "guav                                let name = “guav”
age = 21                                    var age = 21
female = true                               let female = true
```
