## Introduction

Guavascript is a strongly and statically typed language that compiles down to Javascript. With type inference, first class functions, and other features Guavascript is packed with tools to make a programmer's job easier.

Guavascript is a strongly and statically typed language that is likely to get banned by Trump for being too fruity.

Finally a programming language that doesn’t waste your time with overly
unnecessary grammars and symbols. You’re better off spending your time
completing your program as quickly as possible. Guavascript wont crash and
kill your computer either. With our compiler Guavascript becomes Javascript.

## Example Programs

This example program prints out the fibonacci sequence.

Guavascript:                                  Javascript:

```
fibonacci(x) {
	a = 0, b = 1, c
	if (x < 3) {

	}
}







fib x y z
a = 0, b = 1, c
if x < 3
ret 1
while --x > 0
	c = a + b, a = b, b = c
match a
	1 > ret 2.424
	2 > ret 5.135
	_ > ret 4.135
ret c

function fibonacci(x) {
var a = 0, b = 1, c;
if (x < 3) return 1;
while (--x > 0) {
c = a + b, a = b, b = c;
}
return c;
}							
```
